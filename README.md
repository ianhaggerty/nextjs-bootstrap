# NextJS Bootstrap

This is an opinionated stack, pulled together in my endless tinkering. Will likely use in production soon.

- NextJS

  Offers maximum control over content delivery (SSR, SSG, Client-Side, etc). Future-proof, fast, with tons of tooling.

- Redux Toolkit

  I love this project, but I prefer redux saga over thunk. Client-side state persisted with redux persist.

- Typescript

  Everything is strongly typed for maximum type hinting + minimal fuss.
  Even redux, actions, selectors, etc... It all comes for free.

- React-Redux (connect)

  I like to hoist data fetching concerns outside components.
  Components are cleaner, maintainable, re-usable, etc.

- SASS

  With modules, if desired. I love the way Sass makes me think!
  Maximum re-use = creativity and abstract thinking.

- Supabase with GrapQL

  Normalized data + GraphQL = endgame. Supabase makes this ridiculously easy.

#### Coming soon
- Redux Saga

  Tough to master, but without a doubt the cleanest + most powerful way to express async logic flows. Dialing into typescript might be challenging though... we shall see.
